### Hospital Discharge Report structure

#### Advance directives

Used to record information about advance directives made by the patient during hospitalization in accordance with Section 36 of the Czech Act No. 372/2011 Coll., on Health Services (national legislation – Czech Republic).

#### Alerts

Contains particularly important findings (from both past medical history and during hospitalization) that affect or are highly likely to affect the patient’s health status, as well as the nature and scope of medical care to be provided after discharge.

Urgent information includes the sections Allergies and Intolerances and Alerts.

##### Allergies and Intolerances

Lists allergies that manifested in the patient and were assessed as such, as well as other intolerance reactions. This primarily includes allergic reactions to medicinal products and other substances used in the provision of healthcare—such as the triggering substance (agent), the type (nature) of the reaction, and its severity.

##### Warnings

This section includes medical conditions or situations that could lead to emergencies. These may include contraindications for prescribing certain medicinal products or for specific treatment approaches. The described situation may pose a risk not only to the patient but also to others (e.g., in cases of infectious diseases). Failure to consider these warnings may result in clinical errors or compromised patient safety.

#### Encounter

This section contains key information about the type of encounter, including details of the patient's admission such as the date, urgency, admitting physician, department, the place the patient came from, and referral details. It also captures discharge information – the date, destination, discharging department, and the type of discharge. Lastly, it documents individual ward stays, including their timeframes and identification of the departments involved.

##### Reason for admission

The reason for admission should be stated briefly, in a concise and specific manner (e.g., not "general deterioration of condition"). If the cause of the issue is known or recognized at the time of admission, a diagnosis should be provided instead of symptoms (e.g., stroke, peritonsillar abscess, humerus fracture, perianal fistula in Crohn’s disease, etc.). If a diagnosis cannot be provided, two or at most three symptoms should be listed, with the leading symptom stated first.

#### Admission evaluation

This section aims to briefly and clearly describe the patient’s clinical condition at the time of hospital admission, with emphasis on pathological findings. It is particularly important when the reason for admission is an acute condition or deterioration of an existing underlying disease. The description of the admission status is followed by a similarly structured description of the discharge status, from which it should be evident to what extent hospitalization led to changes in the pathological findings observed at admission. In cases where the hospitalization was primarily for the evaluation of a chronic long-term condition, the admission and discharge evaluations may be identical.

##### Objective Findings

All sections of the objective findings allow free-text entry of examination results. In the case of anthropometric data and basic vital signs, a structured (formalized) format is also available – this method of documentation is preferred, as it corresponds to the common data entry approach used in existing information systems.

##### Functional Status

Functional status can be assessed using several different methods, typically focusing on the person’s ability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, eating, and toileting, as well as instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as cooking, shopping, and managing personal affairs.

The assessment of the patient's functional status at admission is carried out primarily in relation to the need for increased care or assistance during hospitalization or for planning and determining the mode of healthcare provision. Functional status may be assessed descriptively and/or in a structured manner according to individual categories of the WHO ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) model. The structured approach is preferred whenever applicable.

#### Patient history

This section consists of data from the patient's medical history. The core of the section is the personal medical history, which includes not only the traditional personal history and gynecological/sexual history, but also information on substance use (abuse), current medication, vaccination status, an overview of implants, and essential medical devices.
This section contains information from the patient’s medical

#### Course of Hospitalization (Hospital stay)

This section provides an overview of the diagnostic and therapeutic care delivered during the patient's hospitalization.

The structured layout enables a clear presentation of findings (examination results) and procedures, particularly in cases where a single or clinically dominant health issue was addressed during the inpatient stay.

Unlike traditional formats, the section begins with a diagnostic summary, followed by selected medication therapy, significant procedures, and implants. Examination results are not mandatory, but those essential for the continuity of care or for diagnostic conclusions are typically included.

The final and core component of this section is the clinical summary – the “narrative” – encompassing the traditional elements of present illness, hospital course, and discharge summary (epicrisis). The clinical summary must clearly show why and how the patient was hospitalized, and how their condition evolved in response to therapeutic interventions. The therapeutic approaches used are presented within the diagnostic context, i.e., in connection with clinically relevant examination results. The clinical summary may conclude with a prognostic outlook and a proposal for further management.

#### Discharge details

The discharge status describes changes compared to the admission status – primarily the resolution of pathological findings, but also any new abnormalities, such as complications that occurred during hospitalization (e.g., stroke, injury, allergic skin reaction).

#### Care plan and other recommendations after discharge

This section is essential for ensuring continuity of care. The recommendations are, in many respects, the outcome of the diagnostic and therapeutic process during hospitalization. They often modify existing treatment approaches, but more commonly expand or significantly alter them.

The content of the section is a clear, sufficiently detailed, and—above all—comprehensible guide for the patient, their caregivers, and for both general and specialized healthcare providers.

Depending on the nature of the condition, specific follow-up measures may not be required in some cases, and pharmacotherapy may not be necessary either.
